# Security Policy

## Reporting

If you find a vulnerability, unsafe automation behavior, exposed secret, or privacy issue in this repository, please report it responsibly.

Preferred public coordination path:
- Canonical repository: https://github.com/AlekseiUL/claudeclaw-BANDA
- Maintainer: Aleksei Ulianov / Sprut_AI
- Telegram channel: https://t.me/Sprut_AI

Please do **not** include real API keys, tokens, private chat logs, personal data, or exploit payloads in public issues.

## Scope

Security reports may include:
- secret leakage or unsafe defaults;
- prompt-injection or tool-execution risks;
- destructive automation without approval gates;
- privacy leaks in templates, examples, scripts, or documentation;
- dependency or installer risks.

## Baseline safety rules

- Keep API keys, Telegram bot tokens, credentials, and private configs out of git.
- Use `.env` / local config files for secrets.
- Review scripts before running them on a real agent workspace.
- Keep destructive actions behind explicit human approval gates.
